		<h1>Sprint #1 - Basic JS and JQuery</h1>

		<p>
			The point of this little game is to try and catch the Snitch. I use a JQuery function to find the X and Y coordinates of the mouse. Whenever they get to close to the Snitch, I have JQuery give the Snitch a new, random location. Below are the current coordinates of the mouse as well. PS: Sorry this Snitch doesnt have wings, but it's still pretty hard to catch.
